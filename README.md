## Installation and local server

If you don't have it already, make sure you have nodeJS installed. 

You will need to install the Angular CLI tool to run this project. You can do so by typing `npm install -g @angular/cli` in to your command line.

After you have cloned the repository, `cd` in to your folder using the command line and then type `npm install`. Once the node modules have downloaded, type `ng serve` to open the site.

One the process is done, you should get a message at the end telling you that your site is available at http://localhost:4200 or whichever port you specified.
